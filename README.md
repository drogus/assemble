# Assemble

This app is not really a thing yet, but eventually will be a mobile app backed by [Assemble API](https://github.com/lizbaillie/assemble-api).

# TODO

- [ ] Get location tracking/finding working
- [ ] Get saving/creating new records working (probs an auth issue)
- [ ] Add push notification for phones
- [ ] Test on an actual phone
- [ ] Send out for styling
